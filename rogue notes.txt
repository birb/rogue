rogue notes:

hotkeys and menus are tedious. 
some things should just happen automatically 
(ex. moving down stairs when you step on them. 
we would have to make sure stairs cant spawn in front of hallways, 
if that happened then the player would be FORCED down the stairs)

use arrow keys to move for the love of god

be able to click self for some kind of inventory option? 
like click self and a popup menu happens to show you what you have.

the little dialog in fights is very cute. keep that. 

turn based fights, based on rolls of a die.

regaining health every step is good
