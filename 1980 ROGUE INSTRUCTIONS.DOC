                          ABSTRACT

          Rogue is a  visual  crt  based  fantasy  game
     which  runs  under  MSDOS / PCDOS  1.25 and 2.10 .
     This paper describes how to play rogue and gives a
     few  hints  for those who might otherwise get lost
     in the Dungeons of Doom.



1.  Introduction

     You have just finished your years as a student  at  the
local  fighter's  guild.   After much practice and sweat you
have finally completed your training and are ready to embark
upon  a  perilous  adventure.  As a test of your skills, the
local guildmasters have sent you into the Dungeons of  Doom.
Your  task  is  to  return  with the Amulet of Yendor.  Your
reward for the completion  of  this  task  will  be  a  full
membership  in the local guild, plus you are allowed to keep
all the loot you bring back from the dungeons.

     In preparation for  your  journey,  you  are  given  an
enchanted  sword, taken from a dragon's hoard in the far off
Dark Mountains.  You are  also  outfitted  with  elf-crafted
armor  and given enough food to reach the dungeons.  You say
goodbye to family and friends for what may be the last  time
and head up the road.

     You set out on your  way  to  the  dungeons  and  after
several days of uneventful travel, you see the ancient ruins
that mark the entrance to the Dungeons of Doom.  It is  late
at  night  so  you  make  camp at the entrance and spend the
night sleeping under the open skies.   In  the  morning  you
gather  your  sword,  put  on your armor, eat what is almost
your last food and enter the dungeons.

2.  What is going on here?

     You have just begun a game of rogue.  Your goal  is  to
grab as much treasure as you can, find the amulet of Yendor,
and get out of the Dungeons of Doom alive.  On the screen, a
map  of  where  you  have been and what you have seen on the
current dungeon level is kept.  As you explore more  of  the
level, it appears on the screen in front of you.

     Rogue differs from most computer fantasy games in  that
it  is  screen  oriented.  Commands are all one or two keys-
trokes and the results of your commands are displayed graph-
ically on the screen rather than being explained in words.

     Another major difference between rogue and  other  com-
puter  fantasy  games  is  that once you have solved all the
puzzles in a standard fantasy game, it has lost most of  its
excitement and it ceases to be fun.  Rogue on the other hand
generates a new dungeon every time you play it and even  the
author finds it an entertaining and exciting game.

3.  What do all those things on the screen mean?

     In order to understand what is going on  in  rogue  you
have to first get some grasp of what rogue is doing with the
screen.  The rogue screen is intended to  replace  the  "You
can  see  ..." descriptions of standard fantasy games.  Here
is a sample of what a rogue screen might look like.
                            ---------------------
                            |...................+
                            |...@...........[...|
                            |........B..........|
                            |...................|
                            --------+------------


  Level: 1     Hits:12(12)   Str:15(15)   Gold:0    Armor:5  Exp:1/0

3.1.  The bottom line

     At the bottom line of the screen is  a  few  pieces  of
cryptic  information,  describing your current status.  Here
is an explanation of what these things mean:

Level   This number indicates how deep you have gone in  the
        dungeon.  It starts at one and goes up forever.

Gold    This is the number of gold pieces you  have  managed
        to find and keep with you so far.

Hits    This is your current and maximum  hit  points.   Hit
        points  indicate how much damage you can take before
        you die.  The more you fight, the  lower  they  get.
        You  can regain hit points by resting. The number in
        parentheses is the maximum number  your  hit  points
        can reach.

Str     This is your current  strength.   This  can  be  any
        integer  less than or equal to ????????.  The higher
        the number, the stronger you are.

Armor   This is your current armor class.  This number indi-
        cates  how effective your armor is in stopping blows
        from unfriendly creatures.  The  lower  this  number
        is, the more effective the armor.

Exp     These two numbers give your current experience level
        and  experience  points.  As you do things, you gain
        experience  points.   At  certain  experience  point
        totals,  you  gain  an  experience  level.  The more
        experienced you are, the  better  you  are  able  to
        fight and to withstand magical attacks.

3.2.  The top line

     The top line of the screen  is  reserved  for  printing
messages   that  describe  things  that  are  impossible  to
represent visually.  If you see  a  "--More--"  on  the  top
line,  this  means that rogue wants to print another message
on the screen, but it wants to make certain  that  you  have
read the one that is there first.  To read the next message,
just press a space.

3.3.  The rest of the screen

     The rest of the screen is the map of the level  as  you
have  explored  it  so  far.   Each  symbol  on  the  screen
represents something.  Here is a list of  what  the  various
symbols mean:

Face This symbol represents you, the adventurer.

- , | These symbols represent the walls of rooms.

+     This is a door to/from a room.

.     This is the floor of a room.

#     This is the floor of a passage between rooms.

*     This is a pile or pot of gold.

Arrow This is a weapon of some sort.

Sqr   This is a piece of armor.

i     This is a flask containing a magic potion.

Music  This is a piece of paper, usually a magic scroll.

Dia   This is a trap, watch out for these.

Grate This is the passage leading down to the next level.

Club  This is a piece of food.

A-Z   The uppercase letters represent  the  various  inhabi-
      tants of the Dungeons of Doom.  Watch out, they can be
      mean.

4.  Commands

     Commands are given to rogue by pressing single letters.
Most  commands  can  be  preceded  by a count to repeat them
(e.g. typing "10s" will do ten searches) The  list  of  com-
mands  is rather long, but it can be read at any time during
the game with the ? command.  Here it is for reference, with
a short explanation of each command.

?     The help command.  Asks for a character to  give  help
      on.   If  you type a *, it will list all the commands,
      otherwise it will explain what the character you typed
      does.
        To restore a saved game: create & run batch file "MR.bat", then run
        "R.Bat"
"R.Bat" consists of:

@echo off
cd\hold
copy rogue.sav c:\games\rogue
cd\games\rogue
rogue rogue.sav

"MR.Bat"" consists of:
@echo off
copy rogue.sav c:\hold
